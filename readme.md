# Squarespace Escape Suppressor

Browser extension to work around bizarre Squarespace site default of
prompting for login when you press escape.

The extension only suppresses escape for Squarespace sites, when no
input is focused. It detects whether the page is a Squarespace site
very efficiently, and so does not waste any browser resources.
