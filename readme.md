# Squarespace Escape Suppressor

Browser extension which disables Squarespace site's behavior of
redirecting to login when Escape key is pressed.

The extension only suppresses escape for Squarespace sites, when no
input is focused. It detects whether the page is a Squarespace site
very efficiently, and so does not waste any browser resources.
